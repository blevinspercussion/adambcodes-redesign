          <h3>Intro To Coding</h3>
          <p>
            In my introductory tutoring sessions, we begin by installing the
            necessary software and setting up our coding environment. All of the
            software that I use is free to download and use or personal or
            commercial use. I will walk you through how to download the
            programming languages (such as Python) as well as the code editor
            (Microsoft VS Code) and how to create a coding project.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my Python classes, we will begin by learning the basic syntax of
            the language as well as basic computer science concepts, such as
            data structures, variables, and working with data. before moving on
            to slightly more advanced topics and data structures like lists,
            dictionaries, and conditional statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before long, we will start writing our own simple text games such as
            a Mad Libs game, guess the number, hangman, and more!

          <h3>Intro To Web Design</h3>
          <p>
            In these sessions, we will begin, as with the Python classes, by
            setting up our coding environment. After that, we will begin by
            learning the basics of HTML, which is a 'markup language' (similar
            to a coding or programming language, but simpler) that is the
            language of the web. We will learn to manipulate text to create our
            own simple web sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            After we learn the basics of HTML, we will dive into CSS, which will
            give us more control over the look and feel of our page, all while
            continuing to delve deeper into more advanced HTML. You will
            eventually be able to create a complete website from scratch,
            including multiple pages, and publish it to the web for anyone to
            see!

          <h3>Intermediate Python</h3>
          <p>
            Once we have the basics out of the way, we can move on to some more
            exciting topics with Python, including doing more complex tasks
            using the Python Standard Library as well as other modules that are
            created by third parties. One of the great things about Python is
            that it is an open source programming language, and there are teams
            of people all over the world who are dedicated to extending the
            capabilities of Python far beyond its original intended uses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uses the tools included with Python we will be able to read and
            write text files, parse through thousands of words of text in mere
            seconds, create spreadsheets, automatically sort through files on
            our computer and much, much more! With the free libraries that are
            available from third parties we can write programs that can download
            Youtube videos to our computer, manipulate images, create social
            media posts, send automated text messages...the sky is truly the
            limit!
          </p>
          <p>
            As if that isn't enough, we will get into the basics of video game
            design with the free Python Arcade library.

          <h3>Intermediate Web Design</h3>
          <p>
            After grasping the basics of HTML and CSS, we will jump into the
            Javascript programming language. Whereas HTML is the content of the
            web and CSS is the look/style of the web, Javascript is the language
            that makes the web interactive. We will start with the basics of
            programming, including syntax, variables, and other concepts. If you
            already have a basic grasp of Python, learning Javascript will be
            much easier, as all programming languages have many basic concepts
            in common.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use Javascript to bring our web pages to life with
            animations, popup menus, and other interactive elements. We can also
            use Javascript to programmaticly create graphics that will allow us
            to make simple video games for the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we will unlock the full potential of Javascript by learning
            how to tap into the power of APIs. An API (application programming
            interface) is a programming language extension that lets us tap into
            powerful data sets or functions or other programs. We can use APIs
            to do anything from getting information about our favorite Pokemon
            or Star Wars characters to getting real-time weather information.
            Would you like to create your own Pokedex? How about a weather app?
            With APIs, you can do all of that and more!

          <h3>Advanced Python</h3>
          <p>
            In the Advanced Python classes we will touch on the topic of 'object
            oriented programming' (OOP) and how to use it to solve more complex
            programming problems. OOP with give you a deeper understanding how
            external modules work and you will even be able to write your own
            Python modules.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also learn about APIs (see the
            <a>intermediate web design</a>
            section above for more on APIs) which will allow us to write Python
            programs that interact with Facebook and Twitter. we can even use
            the OpenAI API to tap into the capabilities of the most powerful AI
            system ever built!

            to check out a Facebook page that I created that is powered by a
            Python program that I wrote called 'The Automated Motivator' (TAM).
            TAM uses the OpenAI API to generate a motivational phrase, then
            overlay it onto an AI generated image before uploading it to the
            Facebook page.

          <h3>Advanced Web Design</h3>
          <p>
            In my Advanced Web Design classes, we will start by exploring object
            oriented programming (OOP) with Javascript. We will learn how to use
            advanced techniques, such as custom web components, to make our own
            HTML tags from scratch that will save us from having to reuse code
            and save us from having to write the same code over and over again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we will learn how to create 'single page apps' (SPAs) using
            the React Javascript library. React is an extremely powerful
            external Javascript library built and maintained (and free to use)
            by the engineers at Facebook. With React we can write HTML right in
            our Javascript files, and it allows us to easily create reusable
            components and make easier use of complex logic.
